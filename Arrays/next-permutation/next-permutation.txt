Solving Approach:

1) We need to find the first decreasing element from the right of the list.
2) Then, we need to find the smallest element from the right side 
that is greater than the first decreasing element.
3) We swap these two elements
4) Finally we reverse the sublist from the first decreasing element to the end of the list.
